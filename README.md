# CSP_Final
This project is created by Chan Hen during the school year of 2017-2018
Repository for my 2.2.3B website project about creating, reading, updating, and deleting information in a database. Storing all the files of coding in Cloud9. Particularly for this project, I have created a database about dogs. The coding will add a certain type of dog about its origin and breed into the database. Afterwards, updating the information to something else by reading the information from user's inputs and other factors. Finally, deleting the information about the dog type. 
The website used in this project was Cloud9 and to navigate there is a website, c9.io
